The Prison Management System (PMS) has been developed to simplify and modernize prison management. The system is meant to replace traditional manual methods of record keeping and administration with a modern digital solution that is secure, accurate and efficient. The PMS enables ease in the management of inmates’ records, monitoring of activities as well as ensuring safety of both inmates and warders.\\

Some of the major aspects about PMS include its ability to facilitate efficient running of jails through its features like adding or removing an inmate from the system, inspecting cell occupancy, assigning rehabilitation jobs among others. Management entails obtaining details about officers on duty and their roles, logging every visitor’s details alongside who they visited, this is because it has powerful search for easily accessible data. It helps streamline operations while improving data accuracy and operational efficiency.\\

Using PMS reduces administrative burden on staff making sure there is more accurate information and smoother operations. It also has reporting tools which assists prison managers in making informed choices. The aim of Prison Management System is therefore directed towards modernizing prison administration, improved data accuracy and enhanced operational efficiency which overall leads into increased safety, effectiveness and correctional facilities performance.\\
