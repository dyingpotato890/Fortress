\subsection*{React (Frontend)}

\subsubsection{Description}
React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where dynamic data is frequently updated and displayed.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
React will be used to create the user interface for the "Prison Management" system. It will handle user interactions and update the UI based on user inputs, ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience.

\subsection*{Python Flask (Backend)}

\subsubsection{Description}
Flask is a lightweight, open-source web framework for Python, designed to make it easy to build web applications.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
Flask will serve as the backend, acting as a gateway between the user interface and the database. It will handle communication with the database through various functions, ensuring smooth data retrieval and manipulation.

\subsection*{MySQL (Database)}

\subsubsection{Description}
MySQL is a popular open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for database operations.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
MySQL will store all the data, which includes details like the list of crimes, prisoner details, staff details, user logins, cell allocations, visitor details, and work assigned to each prisoner.

\subsection*{hashlib (Backend)}

\subsubsection{Description}
The \texttt{hashlib} module implements a common interface for many secure cryptographic hash and message digest algorithms. There is one constructor method for each type of hash, and all return a hash object with the same simple interface.

\subsubsection{Role in Project}
\texttt{hashlib} will be used to ensure data integrity by generating hash values and encrypting the data. This is particularly useful for storing sensitive information like passwords and ensuring that data is not tampered with.
